### Abstract
<p>
    We consider the infinite-horizon, average reward restless bandit problem.  A central challenge is designing computationally efficient policies that achieve a diminishing optimality gap as the number of arms, N, grows large.  Existing policies, including the renowned Whittle index policy, all rely on a uniform global attractor property (UGAP) assumption to achieve asymptotic optimality, which is a complex and difficult-to-verify assumption.  In this talk, I will present new, sampling-based policy designs for restless bandits.  One of our proposed policies breaks the long-standing UGAP assumption for the first time, and the subsequent policies eliminate the need for the UGAP assumption to achieve asymptotic optimality.  Our techniques offer new insights into guaranteeing convergence (avoiding undesirable attractors or cycles) in large stochastic systems.  This talk is based on joint work with Yige Hong (CMU), Qiaomin Xie (UW–Madison), and Yudong Chen (UW–Madison).
