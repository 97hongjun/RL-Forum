### Abstract
<p>
    Tor will give a whirlwind tour of a series of recent papers on the information directed sampling algorithm for sequential decision-making. The results come in three flavours. First, generalising and applying the IDS algorithm to problems with a rich information structure such as convex bandits and partial monitoring. Second, showing a connection between the optimisation problem solved by IDS and the optimisation problem that determines the asymptotic lower bound for stochastic structured bandit problems. Third, showing a deep connection between IDS and the mirror descent framework for convex optimisation.
