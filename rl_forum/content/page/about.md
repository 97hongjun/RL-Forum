    Welcome to the website for the Stanford RL (Reinforcement Learning) Forum.<br>
    <br>
    We hope to develop a growing community of researchers in both industry and academia that are interested in reinforcement learning. With connections to control theory, operations research, computer science, statistics, and many more fields this may include a lot of people! <br>
    <br>
    Details of the upcoming talks will be posted in the talks section. Also, subscribe to the mailing list <a href="https://mailman.stanford.edu/mailman/listinfo/rl-forum-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
