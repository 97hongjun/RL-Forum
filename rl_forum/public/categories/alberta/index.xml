      <description>Logistics   Time: 4:00-5:00 PM; Wednesday 12/06/2023

Assistant Professor,
Unversity of Alberta
Abstract  In many real-world problems the agent is much smaller than the vast world in which it must operate. In such scenarios, the world appears non-stationary to the agent, and thus we require agents capable of stable, non-convergent, never-ending learning. Successful agents must balance specializing their learning to the current situation with the need to learn many things over time which can be combined to learn yet new things--a concept known as scaffolding.</description>

Location: Hewlet 201 Presenter  Rich Sutton
Professor,
Unversity of Alberta
Abstract  For thousands of years, great philosophers, and later, great scientists, have sought to understand intelligence and thereby better understand themselves. As Richard Feynman said “What I cannot create, I do not understand”, so now as we have begun to create intelligence in machines, we might expect to have gained a greater understanding of it.</description>
