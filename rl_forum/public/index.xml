&lt;p&gt;
    Effective decision, exploration, and adaptation often require an agent to know what it knows and, also, what it does not know.
    This capability relies on the quality of joint predictions of labels assigned to multiple inputs.  
    Conventional neural networks lack this capability and, since most research has focused on marginal predictions, this shortcoming has been largely overlooked.
    By assessing the quality of joint predictions it is possible to determine whether a neural network effectively distinguishes between epistemic uncertainty (that due to lack of knowledge) and aleatoric uncertainty (that due to chance).
    We introduce the epistemic neural network (ENN) as a general interface for uncertainty modeling in deep learning.
    While prior approaches to uncertainty modeling can be viewed as ENNs, the new interface facilitates comparison of joint predictions, and the design of novel architectures and algorithms.
    In particular, we introduce the epinet: an architecture that can supplement any existing neural network, including pretrained models and be trained with modest incremental computation to represent uncertainty.
    With an epinet, conventional neural networks outperform very large ensembles, consisting of hundreds or more particles, with orders of magnitude less computation.
    We demonstrate this efficacy across synthetic data, ImageNet, and sequential decision problems.
    As part of this effort we open-source experiment code.

&lt;p&gt;
    This paper considers the problem of online clustering with bandit feedback. A set of arms (or items) can be partitioned into various groups that are unknown. Within each group, the observations associated to each of the arms follow the same distribution with the same mean vector. At each time step, the agent queries or pulls an arm and obtains an independent observation from the distribution it is associated to. Subsequent pulls depend on previous ones as well as the previously obtained samples. The agent&#39;s task is to uncover the underlying partition of the arms with the least number of arm pulls and with a probability of error not exceeding a prescribed constant δ. The problem proposed finds numerous applications from clustering of variants of viruses to online market segmentation. We present an instance-dependent information-theoretic lower bound on the expected sample complexity for this task, and design a computationally efficient and asymptotically optimal algorithm, namely Bandit Online Clustering (BOC). The algorithm includes a novel stopping rule for adaptive sequential testing that circumvents the need to exactly solve any NP-hard weighted clustering problem as its subroutines. We show through extensive simulations on synthetic and real-world datasets that BOC&#39;s performance matches the lower bound asymptotically, and significantly outperforms a non-adaptive baseline algorithm.

&lt;p&gt;
    Multi-armed bandit algorithms minimize experimentation costs required to converge on optimal behavior. They do so by rapidly adapting experimentation effort away from poorly performing actions as feedback is observed. But this desirable feature makes them sensitive to confounding, which is the primary concern underlying classical randomized controlled trials. We highlight, for instance, that popular bandit algorithms cannot address the problem of identifying the best action when day-of-week effects may influence reward observations. In response, this paper proposes deconfounded Thompson sampling, which makes simple, but critical, modifications to the way Thompson sampling is usually applied. Theoretical guarantees suggest the algorithm strikes a delicate balance between adaptivity and robustness to confounding. It attains asymptotic lower bounds on the number of samples required to confidently identify the best action -- suggesting optimal adaptivity -- but also satisfies strong performance guarantees in the presence of day-of-week effects and delayed observations -- suggesting unusual robustness. At the core of the paper is a new model of contextual bandit experiments in which issues of delayed learning and distribution shift arise organically.

    Reinforcement learning agents have demonstrated remarkable achievements in simulated environments. Data efficiency poses an impediment to carrying this success over to real environments. The design of data-efficient agents calls for a deeper understanding of information acquisition and representation. We develop concepts and establish a regret bound that together offer principled guidance. The bound sheds light on questions of what information to seek, how to seek that information, and what information to retain. To illustrate concepts, we design simple agents that build on them and present computational results that demonstrate improvements in data efficiency.

    Deep model-based reinforcement learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art sample efficiency but we lack a theoretical understanding of them. This talk will first show that convergence to a global maximum requires an exponential number of samples even for a one-layer neural net bandit problem, which is strictly easier than RL. Therefore, we propose to study convergence to local maxima. For both nonlinear bandit and RL, I will present a model-based algorithm, Virtual Ascent with Online Model Learner (ViOL), which provably converges to a local maximum with sample complexity that only depends on the sequential Rademacher complexity of the model class. Our results imply novel global or local regret bounds on several concrete settings such as linear bandit with finite or sparse model class, and two-layer neural net bandit.

&lt;p&gt;
    I will discuss in this talk a new diffusion-asymptotic analysis for sequentially randomized experiments. Rather than taking sample size n to infinity while keeping the problem parameters fixed, we let the mean signal level scale to the order 1/\sqrt{n} so as to preserve the difficulty of the learning task as n gets large. In this regime, we show that the behavior of a class of methods for sequential experimentation converges to a diffusion limit. This connection enables us to make sharp performance predictions and obtain new insights on the behavior of Thompson sampling. Our diffusion asymptotics also help resolve a discrepancy between the Θ(log(n)) regret predicted by the fixed-parameter, large-sample asymptotics on the one hand, and the Θ(\sqrt{n}) regret from worst-case, finite-sample analysis on the other, suggesting that it is an appropriate asymptotic regime for understanding practical large-scale sequential experiments.

    Tor will give a whirlwind tour of a series of recent papers on the information directed sampling algorithm for sequential decision-making. The results come in three flavours. First, generalising and applying the IDS algorithm to problems with a rich information structure such as convex bandits and partial monitoring. Second, showing a connection between the optimisation problem solved by IDS and the optimisation problem that determines the asymptotic lower bound for stochastic structured bandit problems. Third, showing a deep connection between IDS and the mirror descent framework for convex optimisation.
